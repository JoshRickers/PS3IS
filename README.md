PS3IS (PS3 Image Search)
======

As computer games consoles become more and more like computers the need for
forensic investigation methodologies and software also increases. Many new games
console have hard drives that are able to store images, films and music on them and
because of this they can be used to store illegal content. Games console can also be
modified to run homebrew applications that give access to hidden areas of the storage of
the games console, adding further hiding places for illegal files. This report describes
different consoles and their method of modification and the implementation of an image
carver for two games consoles.

The PS3 Image Search program will search a specific folder on the internal HDD for .jpg image files. 
The user can then copy these images files to a external USB device.

PS3IS requires the PS3 console to be able to run homebrew, either by custom firmware or hardware modification.
